# Personal-Blog-Website

## Description

The JavaScript code for the Personal Blog Website website is complete according to the following: 

* Main page displays a form that can be filled by user and that issues alert if there are any entries missing.
* There is a Dark Mode toggle button at the upper right corner that changes style upon being clicked.
* When users click on submit and there are no missing fields, data is stored in an array that can be accessed later from local storage.
* Upon submission, user is redirected to blog page where they can see all their blogs in order.
* Five empty slots is the default, but extra slots are added once the base amount of entries is surpassed.
* The footer provides user information and a link to the portfolio website.
* Users can click on the Back button to return to the form page.

## Usage

Users first need to input the data that is required by the form by clicking on the entry boxes. If entries are missing, users are prompted to fill them, and they must click on OK to continue. Once users have decided what to submit, they should click on submit. They can see their entry on the blog page, they are added in order. The blogs start as five empty slots that get filled with user data. Once users go past the maximum, more slots are added to the page. User can see developer information at the bottom of the blog page, and they can click on the portfolio website link to access that website. If users decide to return to the form page, they should click on the Back button. Users can switch between Light Mode and Dark Mode anytime by clicking on the button with a sun icon.
